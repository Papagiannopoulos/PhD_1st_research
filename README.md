### Sex-specific metabolic signatures of adiposity associated with clinical biomarkers in the UK Biobank

The script refered to the machine learning development of my first PhD research project.

In this research I identified Metabolic Signatures (MSs) of eight adiposity indices using a multi-step estimation algorithm built upon adaptive elastic-net regularization ([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2015.1016944)) with stability selection.
This model reduces potential false positives and improves the stability of feature selection, while maintaining the estimation accuracy. The associations between MSs and clinical biomarkers performed applying multivariate linear regression models (MLRm) adjusted for covariates (code for MLRm is not shown).

This research advances the understanding of the pathophysiology of regional and overall obesity and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms through which adiposity impacts health, offering potential directions for future pharmacological or lifestyle interventions.
